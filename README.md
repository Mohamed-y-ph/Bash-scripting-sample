# Bash-scripting-sample
This is a bash script that I coded in order to fulfil the rquirements of the graduation project of NU Bioinformatics Diploma. This code can work as a GUI application or in command line to perform multiple sequence alignment using different tools, visualize phylogenetic tree, find conserved regions, , and design primers for conserved regions. N.B. Pyhton codes which are integrated in the script were not uploaded as they were not coded by me.
